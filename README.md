# ImageClassification
 
#### Dataset:The images of 5 differnert types of pokemon, the images of each type are under the corresponding folder named by that particular pokemon

#### Model: ResNet18,  Loss function: CrossEntropyLoss, Optimizer: Adam Optimizer

#### Training the ResNet model and apply validation and test dataset on it we can get the best accuracy on validation set is 0.9098 and the final test accuracy is 0.8841

#### By using transfer learning and fine-tunning the model, we can get the best accuracy on validation set is 0.9571 and the final test accuracy is 0.9614
