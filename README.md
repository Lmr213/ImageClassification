# ImageClassification

## Dataset: 
### The images of 5 differnert types of pokemon, the images of each type are under the corresponding folder named by that particular pokemon
### After data preprocessing, we can load a bacth of images in he training dataset it looks like below(Using visdom to do visualization)

### Training the ResNet and apply test dataset on it we can get the best accuracy on validation set is 0.9098 and the final test accuracy is 0.8841

### By using transfer learning and fine-tunning the output layer of the model, we can get the best accuracy on validation set is 0.9571 and the final test accuracy is 0.9614
